# ReadingList

An app to keep track of readings, specifically for school / academic readings. Allows the user to assign a priority to a reading 
and when it is completed. 

### Current Status 

Currently still developing some parts of the app, in particular the UI and citation parser. Currently looking at a minor redesign 
of the app to make it more simple for the user and for the citation parser. Plan to have a working version complete by the end of May 2019.
